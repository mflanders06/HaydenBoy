    Huh, that sounds weird.
    I know I didn't ask for this. I wonder if Mom picked it
    up at one of those free comic book exchange things.
    Oh well. It's better than staring at the same comics
    I've been reading since April.<br>
    I really need to figure out a way to get comic books
    more often.<br>
