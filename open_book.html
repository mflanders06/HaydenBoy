        Huh, this sounds weird.
        I know I didn't ask for this book. I wonder if Mom picked it
        up at one of those free comic book exchange things.
        Oh well. It's better than staring at the same comics
        I've been reading since April.<br>
        I really need to figure out a way to get new comic books
        more often.<br>
