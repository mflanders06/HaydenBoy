    <h1>The Amazing Adventures of Hayden Boy!</h1>
    Finally! Home from school. I have some time to myself.
    I crash on my bed and reach to the nightstatnd, where
    I have my comic books.
    <h3>The Amazing Adventures of Hayden Boy!</h3>
    That's weird. I don't remember seeing this one before.
    I wonder where it came from.<br>

    <a href="no_book.html">I put down the book and grab another.</a><br>
    <a href="open_book.html">I begin to read Hayden Boy!</a>
