            I grab spiderman #15 Kraven the Hunter.
            I flip through and look at a few pictures for
            the 1000th time.
            Mom calls, so I go downstairs. She has a turkey sandwich
            for me. Thanks Mom! I yell, as I grab it and head upstairs.
            I look around for that other comic book... but it's
            gone? Huh, that's weird. I thought I saw something
            about Hayden Boy?
            Must have been my imagination.
            I take a bite of the sandwich as I flip through the same
            old comic books.<br>
