        No Hayden Boy :(

        I grab spiderman #15 Kraven the Hunter.
        I flip through and look at a few pictures for
        the 1000th time.
        Mom calls, so I go downstairs. She has a turkey sandwich
        for me. Thanks Mom! I yell, as I grab it and head upstairs.
        I look around for that other comic book... but it's
        gone? Huh, that's weird. I thought I saw something
        about Hayden Boy?
        Must have been my imagination.
        I take a bite of the sandwich as I flip through the same
        old comic books.<br>
        The End<br>
