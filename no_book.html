        No Adventures of Hayden Boy :(

        I grab spiderman #15 Kraven the Hunder.
        I flip through and look at a few pictures for
        the 1000th time.
        Mom calls, so I go downstairs. She has a sandwich
        for me. I grab it and head upstairs.
        I look around for that other comic book... but it's
        gone. Huh, that's weird. I thought I saw something
        about Hayden Boy?
        Must have been my imagination.<br>
        The End<br>
